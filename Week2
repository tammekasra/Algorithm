1. I have figured out more or less how github works and it took me a while to connect VScode with Github.
2. I have made a rather simple game of 4 in a row that I  I will try later to make it 5 or 10 in a row game for fun
The game itself is a turnbased game where the player (here in this case player 1) has to choose from 7 slots where to input his or her 
coin. Player 2 as in A.I (at the moment its a random inputer that stops your winning chances as soon as you have 3 in a row).

I wanted to take chess instead of 4 in a row, but since I am a beginner in this field and I have 2 other courses that I am doing right now
it is best for me to start a little bit easier.

I will for the next week implement the minmax algoritm that is vastly used in a lot of different games such as chess to find the 
so called "optimal" move and seeing all the possible future outputs (obviously chess would be more streneous since it has more combinations than
molecules in the universe).

-Since I have never used python code revewing tools - I might either use Codacy or DeepSource
-I will also implement Coverage.py - tool for test coverage .
   

I did the game 4 in a row for around 5-6 hours in 8-16-2022 and I wanted already to input the minmax algorithm,
but since the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence has this exact topic next week, It would be nice for me to
have full grasp on it before trying to implement it on.

At the moment the simple algoritm that dects whether there would be a winning move for player 1 and it is O(n^3) since it goes through 3
loops.
