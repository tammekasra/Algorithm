First week

-My degree is Theoretical Computer Science - Bachelor Degree
- I am trying to figure out which topic or an project would suit me - either something Chess related, sudoku or a minesweeper A.I
- I have been looking at different algorithms and how to implement them.
-  I have been using Python for almost every other course, I do know little bit of java, but it would be easier for me to do something with Python
-I have no yet decided if I will continue with this course or not, since I took some other courses at the same time, and I have not yet decided which one I will finish
-Also taking the course Introducton to Artificial Intelligence by Teemu Roos, and that course combined with this one one should be suitable for me.
