## Määrittelydokumentti (Specification document)

The main goal is to create a game called 4 connect. Its idea is that there are two players who try to get 4 coins in a row and win the game.
The project uses alpha-beta pruning and minimax algorithm to get the optimal best move.
Minimax goes through all possible options and evaluates each one and returns the "desired" move out of all those options.

All the other descriptions - like time complexity and small details are in described in testausdokumentti, toteusdokumentti and instructions for use
 at - https://github.com/tammekasra/Algorithm

The main reason why I chose this algorithm is that me personally, recursion has been a difficult thing to grasp and minimax just does that and 
this also put me in a situation to look for better algoritms in the internet for future knowledge.

The main programming language is simply python by using modules - pygame (for user interface), random (to shuffle randomly the moves, so the A.I can be unpredictable),
time (to measure how long it takes to execute the minmax algorithm), math (to make simple calculations).
