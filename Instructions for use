The game connect 4

The main idea behind the game is to connect 4 of your own pieces in a line. It can be vertical, horizontal or a diagonally.

There are two options to start the game. First you need to download the whole code from GITHUB. Secondly you need go to a command shell like command prompt.
From there (CMD) go to the directory in which the files were downloaded. From there write 'python play.py' to start the game.

The one who starts the game is randomly chosen using the random module via python!


Whenever it is our turn, we need to either press 0-6 on the command line or use GUI to press on the column we want to insert! 

P.S Whenever you increase the level of depth e.g 10, then the program might start to lagg (just be patient then)!

The game can either be your win, loss or a draw.

P.S . -Before running the program the following modules are needed:
 1) Numpy - pip install numpy
 2) Random - pip install random
 3) Time - pip install time
 4) math  - pip install math
 5) py game -pip install pygame
